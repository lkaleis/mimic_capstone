# mimic_capstone

This is a repository of code for a capstone data science project for the course: CKME136 at Ryerson University.
Visit: https://mimic.physionet.org to learn more about the publicly accessible dataset that is used.

This project focuses on predicting mortality outcome for patients during their first 24h stay in the ICU.
The code is broken down into the 4 following stages:

1) Getting Started

2) Building MIMIC Database in Postgres

3) Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

4) Mortality Prediction

In addition, for stages (1) and (2), a MIMIC code repository shared by the research community was used.
It can be found here: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code
